# 101RACSamples

101RACSamples is a simple collection of experiments with [Reactive Cocoa] (https://github.com/ReactiveCocoa/ReactiveCocoa) to glean a better understanding of how the framework and its operators behave.

## Setup

To setup 101RACSamples:

 1. Make sure cocoa pods is [installed] (http://guides.cocoapods.org/using/getting-started.html)
 1. Open terminal and run 'pod install' from the folder with the xcodeproj file
 1. Open the xcworkspace file in Xcode and run the experiments

## Running the experiments

I've found the following setup in Xcode to be the most conducive for running the experiments.

 1. Open the main.m file in both the assistant and main editor.
 1. Use control-6 to view the list of experiments.
 1. Find the code for the experiment you want to run in the assistant editor.
 1. Scroll down to the bottom of the main editor and type in the name of this experiment.
 1. View the output of the experiment in the output window
