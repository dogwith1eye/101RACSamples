# 101RACSamples

101RACSamples is a simple collection of experiments with [Reactive Cocoa] (https://github.com/ReactiveCocoa/ReactiveCocoa) to glean a better understanding of how the framework and its operators behave.

## Setup

To setup the 101RACSamples

 1. Make sure cocoa pods is [set up] (http://guides.cocoapods.org/using/getting-started.html)
 1. Run pod install from the folder with the xcodeproj file
 1. Open the project in Xcode and run the experiments

## Running the experiments

I've found the following setup in Xcode to be the most conducive for running the experiments.

 1. Open the main.m file in both the assistant and main editor.
 1. Use control-6 to view the list of experiments and view the code for the experiment you want to run in the assistant editor.
 1. Scroll down to the bottom of the main editor and type in the name of the experiment.
 1. View the output of the experiment in the output window

I welcome all feedback and suggestions
